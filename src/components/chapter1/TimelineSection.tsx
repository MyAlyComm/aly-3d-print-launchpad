        3D printing has existed since the 1980s, but it's only recently entered its true arbitrage window 
        for entrepreneurs like you and me. Let me walk you through the evolution:

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Phase 1: The Tinkerer Era (2009-2019)</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">When I was still in elementary school, 3D printing was the domain of engineers and hardcore hobbyists. The printers cost $2,000+ and required extensive technical knowledge just to get a basic cube to print correctly.</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
            <li>Constant troubleshooting</li>
            <li>Manual calibration for hours</li>
            <li>Limited material options</li>
            <li>Primarily DIY kits, not ready-to-use machines</li>
            <li>Non-existent customer base outside of techies</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Phase 2: The Transition Period (2020-2023)</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">As I entered my teens, the industry began to shift. Printers became more reliable, prices dropped below $1,000, and the software improved dramatically.</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
            <li>The rise of plug-and-play printers that actually worked</li>
            <li>Expanded material options beyond basic plastics</li>
            <li>Growing online communities sharing knowledge</li>
            <li>First wave of small businesses primarily serving niche markets</li>
