        There's a million different ways to sell your 3D prints. In fact, between social media platforms and sales channels combined 
        with the various softwares and content strategies associated with each - it can be incredibly overwhelming.

          In your first 60 days, you don't need to be everywhere. You need to master one platform first, then expand strategically.

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3">The Platform Strategy</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            For people starting out I suggest picking a platform that already has traffic. If you spend a month building the world's best website but nobody knows it exists, you're not going to make very many sales.
          </p>
          
          <p className="font-medium border-l-4 border-green-500 pl-4 mb-4">
            In the beginning your time is best spent by going somewhere there's already buyers. I started out by selling on Facebook Marketplace. It costs nothing to post, you can make listings in seconds, and with strategic pricing and keywords you can get eyeballs on your listings in minutes.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I made enough money on Facebook in my first month that I was able to buy 7 more printers before I ever had a website.

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">The Current Arbitrage Window: AI</h3>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Remember the Arbitrage Windows from Chapter 1—those rare moments when opportunity meets low barriers to entry? Fifteen years ago ecommerce was wide open. Platforms like Shopify were young, competition was sparse, and you could sell almost anything with minimal expertise.
      </p>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Today, ecommerce demands sleek websites, killer ad creatives, and savvy social media strategies to stand out. Seven years ago social media was the golden ticket. Partnering with influencers was a breeze, and ads on platforms like Instagram were dirt cheap. Those windows have since narrowed.
      </p>

        <p className="text-purple-900 font-medium">
          But right now, a new window is swinging open: <span className="font-bold">AI</span>. Small business owners and side hustlers who tap into the flood of AI tools—released almost daily—can do months of work in minutes and create orders of magnitude more value with a few simple clicks.

        I say this not to hype you up but to remove any fears or limiting beliefs you may have about your ability to sell. With the right tech stack you have a team of the greatest marketers to ever live at your disposal (and for free too).

      <p className="font-medium text-gray-800">
        Your limiting factor in this business is not creativity, budget or location - it's your time and the way you spend it. For that reason, I'm going to show you how to pick the right platform for you and your products and the importance of mastering it before going to the next.

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">Real Success Stories: It's Less About What You Sell</h3>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Having consulted for and collaborated with over a thousand 3D printing businesses, I've seen the incredible scope of the industry firsthand. And it's way, way bigger than you think.
      </p>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        People know about the power sellers on Etsy pumping out dragons and toys, they know about the local tinkerer who sells cosplay helmets or the college kid selling keychains. But they don't know that all around the world there are 3D printing entrepreneurs finding massive 5, 6 and 7 figure levels of success across almost every single product category.

          <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">Project Trill's Story</h4>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Project Trill, a creator in rural USA messaged me about a month ago on Instagram. He was maxing out the office room in his house and reached out to ask if he should expand to a nearby commercial space.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Since commercial rent is expensive I offered this exact advice: "If you really need the space and you really believe in the business then I would absolutely go for it. But first you should consider this: a home based hustle means you never have to leave the comfort of your abode to go to work. Those 15 or 20 minutes commuting each way adds up - that's 2.5+ hours a week spent driving that you could be spending making sales or improving systems."
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Luckily for Trill the rent was cheap and the location not too far away. He pulled the trigger.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-green-700 font-medium">
            "And less than a month later he did. $3000 this week! And all from easter eggs."
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4">
            For a guy with no background in marketing located in one of the less affluent and rural regions of the US, that kind of money is no joke. Especially when you consider his startup costs were less than that. But here's the crazy part: all of that was local sales. It wasn't including any ecommerce.

          <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">Juri's Story</h4>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            On the opposite end of the spectrum I want to introduce you to Juri Pranjic and his business Forma Studios. I met Juri through Instagram when I reached out to him one day asking for product design advice.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            I knew of him through his thoughtfully designed, chill vibes earth tone set of minimalist planters and desk accessories that he designs and sells commercial licenses to around the world.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            As a 20 year veteran of the 3D printing industry Juri was one of the first people to ever be sponsored by a printing company, and he's seen just about everything since then.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            In a recent zoom call Juri was telling me about his idea to open a local makerspace. Sort of a 3D printing cafe where anyone could pick a print, have a snack and leave later with their new creation. He explained how the previous weekend in his tiny and quaint Swiss mountain village he visited a local flower shop and pitched them on the idea of carrying some of his inventory.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-green-700 font-medium">
            A quick handshake and 400 bucks in sales later Juri walked out with a new distributor for his planters.

          It just goes to show you that even someone who's been in the game for 2 decades doesn't have to reinvent the wheel when it comes to making sales. In both of these cases these guys took fairly simple easy to produce products and with a proactive approach they landed decent size batch orders with minimal effort and no marketing spend.
