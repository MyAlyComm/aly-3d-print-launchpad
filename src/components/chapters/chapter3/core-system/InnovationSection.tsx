      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">The "Plus 1 Innovation"</h3>
      <p>
        The remaining 20% of your time is dedicated to your "Plus 1" - developing a new product or approach 
        that isn't yet part of your core offering.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-3">
        This 20% is your innovation sandboxâ€”where you experiment with new ideas without risking your core 
        business. It's separate from your day-to-day operations but informed by what you're learning from 
        your main products.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-3">The Plus 1 serves several crucial functions:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-2">
        <li>
          <span className="font-medium">Insurance against market changes:</span> If one of your core products starts underperforming, 
          you already have a potential replacement in development.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="font-medium">Opportunity for breakthrough growth:</span> Sometimes your experimental product becomes 
          your biggest seller, outperforming your planned core lineup.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="font-medium">Creativity outlet:</span> It prevents stagnation and burnout by giving you space to 
          explore new ideas.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="font-medium">Market testing ground:</span> It allows you to test new concepts with minimal risk before 
          committing significant resources.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="font-medium">Learning accelerator:</span> Working on something new forces you to develop additional 
          skills and knowledge that often benefit your core products.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
