          In traditional business the concept of value add is when you take something, 
          make it better, and together the combined effort increases the output value. 
          Traditionally this results in a product or service where the margin is a few 
          times what it costs to produce.

              If you ask Chat GPT to write you a business plan for 3D printing, it's going 
              to suck. Not only that but it's going to trick you.

              It's going to make it sound like it has a great, unique and actionable plan 
              for you to follow. But in reality it's all horsesh*t in a nice looking box.

              That's because it lacks context, it lacks human creativity and it lacks 
              relevant data. 3D Printing is so new and evolving so quickly, that the LLM's 
              aren't adapted yet.
