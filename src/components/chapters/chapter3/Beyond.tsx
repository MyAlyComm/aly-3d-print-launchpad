      <p>
        In traditional business the concept of value add is when you take something, 
        make it better, and together the combined effort increases the output value. 
        Traditionally this results in a product or service where the margin is a few 
        times what it costs to produce.

      <p>
        But here's where you're going to have an unfair advantage. One that will allow 
        you to create 10x as much value in the same period of time.

        <p>
          If you ask Chat GPT to write you a business plan for 3D printing, it's going 
          to suck. Not only that but it's going to trick you. It's going to make it 
          sound like it has a great, unique and actionable plan for you to follow. But 
          in reality it's all horsesh*t in a nice looking box.

        <p className="mt-4">
          And that's because it lacks context, it lacks human creativity and it lacks 
          relevant data. 3D Printing is so new and evolving so quickly, that the LLM's 
          aren't adapted yet - there's simply not enough publicly accessible information 
          for them to draw on.

        You see in order for AI to give you good personalized advice it needs a lot, 
        a lot more than you'd think. So tomorrow, you'll have access to MyAly.ai - a 
        suite of Agents, digital humans basically, that you can wield to create value 
        in the real world.

        <p>
          The frontier of Agentic AI is just beginning, and by the end of this year, 
          2025 - the tech world will be evolving so fast that the Singularity will be 
          upon us. Stock markets will have cataclysmic (and often clueless) knee jerk 
          reactions, businesses will lay off workers and hire for new roles, and the 
          intersection of neural implants, robotics and autonomous vehicles will have 
          profound implications on our everyday lives.
