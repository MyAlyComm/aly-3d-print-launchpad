      <p className="text-gray-700">
        3D printing has existed since the 1980s, but it's only recently entered its true arbitrage window for entrepreneurs like you and me. Let me walk you through the evolution:

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            When I was still in elementary school, 3D printing was the domain of engineers and hardcore hobbyists. The printers cost $2,000+ and required extensive technical knowledge just to get a basic cube to print correctly.

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            As I entered my teens, the industry began to shift. Printers became more reliable, prices dropped below $1,000, and the software improved dramatically.
