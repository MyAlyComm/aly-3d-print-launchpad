      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">STEP 3: CALCULATING YOUR FINAL SCORE & MAKING DECISIONS</h2>
      
      <p>
        Now that you've completed both critical evaluations in the PROFITS MATCH framework, 
        the final step is to combine these scores into a comprehensive evaluation and make 
        informed decisions about which products to pursue.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">CALCULATING THE FINAL PROFITS MATCH SCORE</h3>
        <p>
          The final score is calculated by taking the average of your PROFITS and MATCH scores:
        </p>
        <p className="my-2 font-bold">Final Score = (PROFITS Score + MATCH Score) ÷ 2</p>
        <p>
          This equally weights both market potential and personal alignment, recognizing that both 
          are essential for success.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          Example: PROFITS Score: 94/100
          <br />MATCH Score: 81/100
          <br />Final Score = (94 + 81) ÷ 2 = 87.5 = 88/100
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="mt-6 p-6 bg-amber-50 border border-amber-200 rounded-lg">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">INTERPRETING YOUR FINAL SCORE</h3>
        <p>The final score provides a comprehensive evaluation of the product's potential for YOU specifically:</p>
        <ul className="mt-2 space-y-1">
          <li><strong>90-100:</strong> Exceptional match — rare perfect alignment of product and person</li>
          <li><strong>80-89:</strong> Excellent match — strong product with great personal alignment</li>
          <li><strong>70-79:</strong> Good match — viable product with positive alignment</li>
          <li><strong>60-69:</strong> Moderate match — acceptable but with gaps to address</li>
          <li><strong>Below 60:</strong> Poor match — reconsider or address significant weaknesses</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div className="mt-8">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">UNDERSTANDING THE SCORE COMPONENTS</h3>
        <p>
          When making decisions, it's important to understand the relationship between your 
          PROFITS and MATCH scores:
        </p>
        
        <div className="mt-4 p-4 bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold">Balanced Scores</h4>
          <p>
            When PROFITS and MATCH scores are similar (within 10-15 points), this indicates a balanced 
            opportunity where both market potential and personal alignment are in harmony.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            <strong>Example:</strong> PROFITS: 85, MATCH: 78
            <br />Final Score: 81.5 (Excellent match)
            <br />Interpretation: Strong market potential combined with good personal alignment
          </p>
        </div>

        <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Divergent Scores</h4>
        <p>
          When there's a large gap between your PROFITS and MATCH scores (20+ points difference), 
          you need to carefully consider the implications:

            <br />Final Score: 75 (Good match)
            <br />Interpretation: Excellent product with challenging personal alignment
            <br />Consideration: Can you improve the personal alignment factors or find a similar
